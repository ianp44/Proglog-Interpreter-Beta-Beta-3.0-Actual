# Proglog-Interpreter-Beta-Beta-3.0-Actual

Ian's Javascript Beta Beta Prolog AI Language Interpreter, not fully functional.
18/12/16

This is the development code for a Javascript Prolog Interpreter, not yet fully functional. 

I've put it on github mainly to register the code for copyright reasons.

To run it/test it download the key files and just open the HTML page. 
That's the HTML file and all the .js javascript include files and the .css file.

Prolog is probably a bit out of date now, but can support a lot of artificial intelligence functionality.

This demo can create and display a rule list. Also compiles and displays rule varable index list.

About the Test Buttons 
The test and display functor routines button creates and displays some functor trees, including with proper Prolog Variables.

The create rule base and display button creates some Prolog rules and puts them into the rule base, then displays the entire rule base. 

The dump label table button displays all the internal program symbols from the label table.

To see the program output after you have clicked the buttons, scroll down the page.
